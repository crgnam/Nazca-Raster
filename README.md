# Quipu Geometry Virtualization
A Geometry Virtualization system

Because this project makes use of submodules for some of its dependencies, it is recommended that you clone using:
```
git clone git@github.com:crgnam/Quipu.git
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository with all submodules by using:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git@github.com:crgnam/Quipu.git
```
(This is not necessary as the `setup.sh` script will retrieve all necessary submodules required to build the project)


# Quick Setup (Bash Sehll Script)
This script will build the dependencies and then build the project.
```
./setup.sh
```
